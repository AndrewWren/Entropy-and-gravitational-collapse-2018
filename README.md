# Patterns-of-entropy-creation-in-gravitational-collapse
This contains the Mathematica calculations cited in Patterns of entropy creation in gravitational collapse, Wren (2018), submitted to MNRAS. All the paper's figures are also generated.

This respository contains a Mathematica notebook ("Calculations...") which does the calculations and creates the figures, and a data file. The data file should be saved in the directory from which your Mathematica reads files in order for the notebook to work.

The notebook and data sheet were built in Mathematica 11.1.1.0
