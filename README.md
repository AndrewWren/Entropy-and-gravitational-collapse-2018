# Entropy-and-gravitational-collapse-2018
This contains the Mathematica calculations cited in *A core-halo pattern of entropy creation in gravitational collapse*, Andrew J. Wren, MNRAS 477(3), 3983-4008 (2018), https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty786 and [arxiv: 1706.03487](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03487). All the paper's figures are also generated.

This respository contains a Mathematica notebook ("Calculations...") which does the calculations and creates the figures, together with a data file.  The data file should be saved in the directory from which your Mathematica reads files in order for the notebook to work.

If not already set up, you will need to configure MaTeX - see http://szhorvat.net/pelican/latex-typesetting-in-mathematica.html

The notebook and data sheet were built in Mathematica 11.1.1.0 for Windows - and may or may not fully work in other versions.  It is possible to re-install 11.1.1.0
